# Changelog

All notable changes to **LongParser** are documented here.

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased] — planned 0.1.6

### Added

- Extractor classification, heading/hierarchy, page-validation, optional-backend guard and LaTeX OCR setup tests, verified without model dependencies on Python 3.10–3.13.
- Offline pipeline, PII redaction, reference, summary and language/RTL/OCR regression tests, with a separate minimal-dependency verification environment and fresh-process default-routing isolation check.
- Controlled regression tests for hybrid chunking, provenance, quality scoring and semantic boundary edge cases, using offline external-resource stubs.
- Opt-in CPU embedding tests with a pinned local MiniLM snapshot and fixed labelled examples; regular CI does not require model assets.

### Changed

- Raised the whole-production coverage minimum from the provisional 17% to 45%, based on 47.53% measured coverage after the planned test milestones; full CI matrix validation remains pending.
- CI now enforces all configured Ruff rules, with reviewed import and Python 3.10+ annotation cleanup.
- FastAPI dependency defaults retain their existing behavior through a targeted `B008` exception for the server application.
- The license check detects bare and dotted Marker imports in core files while retaining the two isolated extractor exceptions.
- Added regression tests that execute the actual license-check workflow script and verify lightweight imports in a fresh Python process.
- Coverage now includes every production module, with a measured 18.96% baseline and a provisional 17% minimum; the final gate will be raised after the planned test milestones.
- Added non-blocking informational mypy checks to CI and documented the coverage measurement policy.
- Removed the unused, empty server routers package and its stale documentation reference; API routes remain in `app.py`.

### Fixed

- PyMuPDF extraction can now instantiate by implementing the required single-page method, preserving selected-page dimensions and source references and reporting invalid page requests clearly.
- Automatic native-PDF routing now falls back to Docling when the PyMuPDF constructor reports a missing optional dependency, including normal OCR language resolution.
- Equation context carried into another chunk now retains its source page, and outgoing chunks report only the pages of their remaining source blocks.
- Optional-backend installation errors now explicitly retain their original exception causes.
- Vector insertion explicitly uses `zip(strict=False)` to preserve existing truncation behavior.

## [0.1.5] — 2026-05-05

### Added

- **Semantic chunking** — `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embedding-based boundary detection in `HybridChunker` (optional via `use_semantic_chunking`).
- **Cross-reference resolution** — Highly efficient $O(N)$ resolution for explicit ("Figure 3") and implicit ("the table below") references via spatial proximity.
- **Summary chunks** — Asynchronous ARQ background worker (`enrich_summaries_job`) to auto-generate LLM section summaries for hierarchical RAG retrieval.
- **Chunk quality scorer** — Zero-ML, heuristic-based chunk scoring using block token confidences, Dictionary Word Coverage (`/usr/share/dict/words`), and fastText Lang-ID validation.
- **PII redaction** — Hybrid approach using fast Regex+Luhn (Emails, Phones, SSNs, CCs, IPs) and optional spaCy NER (`en_core_web_sm`) for names, organizations, and locations. Preserves original values in secure block metadata for HITL.

### Changed

- Bumped `marker-pdf` version support in dependencies.
- Added `ner` optional dependency group (`spacy>=3.7.0`) in `pyproject.toml`.
- Expanded `ChunkingConfig` and `ProcessingConfig` with new semantic, summary, and PII toggle options.
- Marked Phase 1 as officially complete in Roadmap.

## [0.1.3] — 2026-04-13

### Fixed

- **Source code**: Added `DocumentPipeline` as a public alias for `PipelineOrchestrator` —
  docs, quickstart, and all examples now use this name consistently
- **Documentation**: Fixed wrong coverage path `long_parser` → `longparser` in `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- **Documentation**: Replaced stale `cleanrag-api` reference in Docker deployment docs
- **Documentation**: Standardized Gemini API key env var to `GOOGLE_API_KEY` across all docs
- **Source code**: Updated default LLM model fallback from `gpt-4o` to `gpt-5.3` in
  `schemas.py`, `llm_chain.py`, and `engine.py`
- **Source code**: Renamed stale `cleanrag:` Redis key prefix to `longparser:` in embeddings

### Changed

- Python 3.13 added to CI matrix, badges, and installation docs
- `SECURITY.md` updated with Redis rate-limiting and CORS threat mitigations

---

## [0.1.2] — 2026-04-05

### Changed

- Project logo added to documentation site, README, and PyPI page
- Documentation site header updated — logo replaces text title
- Installation guide restructured for clarity

---

## [0.1.1] — 2026-04-04

### Added

- **CPU / GPU install separation** — dedicated `[cpu]` and `[gpu]` meta-extras for clean one-command installs
- **`faiss-gpu`** extra (`faiss-gpu>=1.7`) as a distinct option from `faiss-cpu`
- **Granular torch-based extras** — `embeddings-cpu`, `embeddings-gpu`, `latex-ocr-cpu`, `latex-ocr-gpu` for fine-grained dependency control

### Fixed

- Package metadata: license field updated to SPDX expression format per PEP 639
- Documentation site build reliability improvements

### Changed

- `[gpu]` is now the recommended default install — one command, works on both GPU and CPU machines
- `[cpu]` documented as the advanced path for size-constrained environments (Docker, edge, CI)
- `[all]` now resolves to `[cpu]` as a safe, dependency-minimal default
